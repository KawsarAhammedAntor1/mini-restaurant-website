Hey!
This is a small restaurant website I put together so you can check out menus, prices, and get a little feel of the place online.
It’s simple, clean, and easy to use — no complicated stuff here. You’ll find a homepage, menu, and contact section built with basic HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
I kept everything straightforward so you can tweak it or add your own touch anytime. No worries — it’s super beginner-friendly and easy to get running.
